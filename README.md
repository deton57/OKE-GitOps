## Welcome to OKE - GitOps Workshop ##

You are welcome to a live workshop hosted by Oracle in collaboration with OQVA, that will shade light on how to use Oracle managed Kubernetes with the cutting edge GitOps approach.

GitOps is a new paradigm of implementing CD (continuous delivery) for cloud-native applications. This approach focuses on operating cloud infrastructure using tools that developers are already familiar with.
